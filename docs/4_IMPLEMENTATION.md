## 1. New Laravel+Docker project

The official Docker Guide [Develop and Deploy Laravel applications with Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/guides/frameworks/laravel/)
provides a fresh Laravel project [dockersamples / laravel-docker-examples](https://github.com/dockersamples/laravel-docker-examples),
that implements exactly the architecture proposed in [3_ARCHITECTURE/4.3 System Structure](3_ARCHITECTURE.md#43-system-structure).

- a Docker Compose stack with
- an `nginx` container
- a `php-fpm` container
- a `postgres` container

It is documented how to work with it in the [Developer Docs](../DEVELOPER-DOCS.md) and the [Base Project README](BASE-PROJECT-README.md).

After adding the fresh Laravel+Docker project, I removed Redis from it, because I won't need it.

## 2. Install Filament and create Artisan command for making admin users

- [install Filament v4](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/introduction/installation)

```shell
composer require filament/filament:"^4.0"
php artisan filament:install --panels
```

- adapt the `User` model to (1) allow all users to access the Filament panel and (2) support admin users.
  - put the `is_admin` flag in the `create_users_table` migration and applied the change via `php artisan migrate:fresh`
- created a `make:filament-admin` artisan command by extending the `Filament\Commands\MakeUserCommand`
- removed the `/` route in `web.php` to allow the filament panel (with `path: ''`) to control that route
- removed redis usage from the `.env` and `.env.example`

After that I created myself an admin user, checked that I could access the panel at `http://localhost` and verified by
looking into the database, that the `is_admin` flag is set to `true` for that user.

## 3. Add profile page and fully implement the data model

- add `->profile()` in the `MainPanelProvider` to enable Filament v4's built-in profile page for users
- according to the database schema shown in [3_ARCHITECTURE/4.4. Data Model](3_ARCHITECTURE.md#44-data-model), for the `User` and `WaffleEating` entities
  - create/adapt the migrations
  - create/adapt the models
  - create/adapt the factories
  - write the data seeding

Now I just run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed` and there's my admin user and some more data in the database.

## 4. Add the users CRUD page (only for admins)

- add the Users CRUD (`php artisan make:filament-resource User`) and customize it
- make it only accessible to admins via a UserPolicy (`php artisan make:policy UserPolicy`) and the `UserResource#shouldRegisterNavigation` method

## 5. Enhance the users CRUD page (only for admins)

There are [Relation Managers](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/resources/managing-relationships#relation-managers---interactive-tables-underneath-your-resource-forms)
in Filament, which are interactive tables below resources that allow managing related records without leaving
the resource's Edit or View page.

Let's use that to always have a table of all WaffleEating records below the User View/Edit form,
when the admin  clicks on a user on the CRUD page. Very practical, to be able to manage it here straight-away!

- create the [relationship manager](https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/resources/managing-relationships#creating-a-relation-manager) (`php artisan make:filament-relation-manager UserResource waffleEatings date`)

## 6. Fix user -> waffleEating FK relation

- it's supposed to be a `user_id` for who ate the waffles and the `entered_by_user_id` for who entered the WaffleEating record -> implement that fix
- remove the vite server (`npm install` & `npm run dev`) from the developer docs, because we don't need/use it (Filament v4â€™s core CSS and JS assets are prebuilt and published in the `public` folder)

Some helpful documentation pages:

- https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/actions/create#customizing-data-before-saving
- https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/tables/overview#accessing-related-data-from-columns

> Commits:

> - `1288e4cc`: `fix: use user_id for who ate the waffles & entered_by_user_id for who entered the record`

## 7. Add the waffles CRUD page

- add the WaffleEating CRUD (`php artisan make:filament-resource WaffleEating`) and customize it
  - implement search and filters for the CRUD table
- restrict access via a WaffleEatingPolicy (`php artisan make:policy WaffleEatingPolicy`)
- have the `created_at` and `updated_at` columns in all resource tables, but hidden by default
- fix the `DatabaseSeeder.php`: while creating the 20 random WaffleEating records, it created 2 x 20 new users (unintended)
- after create/edit of a record, redirect to the listing table (implemented in `MainPanelProvider.php`)

Some helpful documentation pages:

- https://filamentphp.com/docs/4.x/tables/columns/overview#making-toggleable-columns-hidden-by-default

Interesting observation:

Here, setting the `entered_by_user_id` using the `->mutateDataUsing()` function as done in the previous commit in the `WaffleEatingsRelationManager.php` did not work at all.

- I tried chaining that method on the `CreateAction::make()` in `Pages/ListWaffleEatings.php`, where it is defined, but it did not work.
- Similarly, chaining it on the `EditAction::make()` in `Tables/WaffleEatingsTable.php` did do anything.

The solution that worked was to define `mutateFormDataBeforeCreate()` and `mutateFormDataBeforeSave()` methods in the
`Pages/CreateWaffleEating.php` and `Pages/EditWaffleEating.php`.

## 8. Add the leaderboard page

- add the leaderboard as a Custom Page in Filament (`php artisan make:filament-page Leaderboard`)
